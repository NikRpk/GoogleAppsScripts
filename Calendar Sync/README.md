### Calendar Sync
This is a mini tool that copies events from one calendar into another one. This can be useful if you have a work calendar and personal one and want to block time between the two without having to fully move into only one calendar. 

### Instructions
1. Create a new Apps Script. 
2. Please copy the contents of the sync.js file into that file. 
3. Set a trigger to run this script every few minutes (would suggest 10 mins).
