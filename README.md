# GoogleScripts

This is just a collection of mini scripts and tools that you can use in your own projects. 

## Introduction <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49123781/209133842-9d18716e-5044-43df-b343-cf420333f792.png" width="40">
General scripts and an introduction to Google Apps Scripts can be found in the wiki section of this [repository](https://github.com/NikRpk/GoogleAppsScripts/wiki). 

## Tools <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49123781/209132970-3c9736b5-195e-472e-9ef4-8e12d1f6e204.png" width="30">

Complete tools and addons can be found each folder in this repository. I try to keep them up to date as far as possible. Feel free to copy them and adapt them to be more efficient or add additional functions. Please let me know as I am always interested in seeing how these can be improved and augemented.
