# Theme Colour Editor - Google Add-On

The aim of this add-on is to allow you to set the custom colours in your Google Sheet quickly and save these colours across all of your worksheets so that you don't have to manually input hexadecimal numbers each time you want to style a new sheet! 

Please find the complete code used to create this add-on in the files in this repository. Feel free to copy or adapt it to fit your own custom needs. 

You can install the add-on right [here](https://google.com).

#### Nothing happens when I click on "Save colours & Change Theme"
The most common reason is that you are logged into multiple google accounts and are currently using one that is not the default. 
   1. You could log out of all accounts and only log into one account. 
   2. You could open the sheet using your main account.
